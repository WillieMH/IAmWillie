      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Doorstep Delivery Driver, Morrisons (Oct 20 - Present)</button>
      <div class="content">I started with Morrisons in October 2020 while I was on furlough from my own aviation business.
        Originally employed as a delivery driver for the doorstep delivery scheme Morrisons had started at the beginning of the covid pandemic
        to serve elderly and vulnerable customers in Ayrshire who were unable to leave the house and had no access to the internet.
        <br/><br/>
        The role entailed picking customers shopping in the store from an order list, delivering the shopping to the customers as well as
        putting the shopping away for some of the less able customers.  Responsibilities covered the whole process from pick to the delivery as
        well as ensuring payments and refunds were processed correctly and any other problems were dealt with in a largely autonomous role.
        <br/><br/>
        Although, not a part of the job description, it was an essential part of the job to interact with the customers over and above delivering
        their groceries as some of the customers didn't see anyone from one delivery to the next.  This has helped me develop my interpersonal skills
        with a group of people that I have never worked with before.

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Aircraft Technician/Director, WMH Aviation Ltd (Oct 17 - Oct 21)</button>
      <div class="content">This was my own company set up to enable me to work independently as an contract mechanical aircraft technician on civilian
        aircraft.  This included sourcing my own contracts for work and during this time I worked on a variety of aircraft types across the UK and Europe.
        <br/><br/>
        The typical contracts worked were base maintenance jobs, carrying out scheduled maintenance tasks on the aircraft and rectifying faults as they arose.
        All the workplaces required the ability to read and work from aircraft maintenance manuals accurately and the recording of all work carried out on both
        paper and computerised systems.  All work was done within EASA/CAA regualtions and strict adherence to health and safety processes.
        <br/><br/>
        Unfortunatly, due to the downturn in work available during the Covid pandemic and then the change in government tax regulations regarding personal service
        companies, the business ceased trading.

      <button type="button" class="collapsible">Aircraft Technician, Morson International (Apr 11 - Oct 17)</button>
      <div class="content">In April 2011 I had an opportunity to return to aircraft work on Tornado GR4 at RAF Lossiemouth during Op Telic.  This was carrying out
        rapid maintenance on the aircraft to enable the flying programme to be adhered to which required flexible working hours.  At the end of Op Telic I was
        offered a position carrying out depth maintenance on Tornado GR4 aircraft at RAF Marham where I worked until October 2017, latterly in a Hydraulic and Pneumatic
        bay.
        <br/><br/>
        On aircraft, the role entailed all aspects of major depth maintenance on the aircraft, from initial strip and technical inspections, to rebuilds and functional
        tests in preparation of the flight test before the aircraft was returned to service.  As well as the mechanical aspects of the role, record keeping of the work
        carried out had to carried out and inputted to the engineering computer systems.
        <br/><br/>
        The last placement in this role involved stripping, reconditioning, repair and functional testing of aircraft hyrdaulic and pneumatic components.  I moved on from
        working on Tornado aircraft as the life of the platform was coming to an end in the UK.
